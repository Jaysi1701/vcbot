# Team Syncc Voice Controlled Robotic Vehicle


## Introduction
Team Syncc AIOT Serbot project.


### Role 
This project details the design and implementation of a Voice-Controlled Robotic Vehicle managed remotely via voice commands. The system comprises two main blocks—transmitter and receiver—each powered by an ESP32 microcontroller and a battery. The transmitter block is equipped with a Bluetooth transmitter module interfaced through an encoder, alongside a voice-recognition module and push-button switches for command input. Voice or button-activated commands are encoded and transmitted via Bluetooth to the receiver, which decodes them to control the robot’s movement: forward, backward, left, or right.
